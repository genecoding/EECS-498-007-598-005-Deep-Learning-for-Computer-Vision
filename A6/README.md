## Assignment 6
### Q1: Variational Autoencoder
The notebook variational_autoencoders.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of a VAE on the MNIST dataset. This will allow you to generate new data, and to interpolate in the latent space.
### Q2: Generative Adversarial Networks 
The notebook generative_adversarial_networks.ipynb will walk you through the implementation of fully-connected and convolutional generative adversarial networks on the MNIST dataset.
