## Goals
### Assignment 1
In this assignment, you will first learn how to use PyTorch on Google Colab environment. You will then practice putting together a simple image classification pipeline, based on the k-Nearest Neighbor, and finally will learn how to use Autograder for evaluating what you implement. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* Develop proficiency with PyTorch tensors
* Gain experience using notebooks on Google Colab
* Understand the basic Image Classification pipeline and the data-driven approach (train/predict stages)
* Understand the train/val/test splits and the use of validation data for hyperparameter tuning
* Implement and apply a k-Nearest Neighbor (kNN) classifier
* Learn how to test your implementation on Autograder

### Assignment 2
In this assignment, you will implement various image classification models, based on the SVM / Softmax / Two-layer Neural Network. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* Implement and apply a Multiclass Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier
* Implement and apply a Softmax classifier
* Implement and apply a Two-layer Neural Network classifier
* Understand the differences and tradeoffs between these classifiers
* Practice implementing vectorized gradient code by checking against naive implementations, and using numeric gradient checking

### Assignment 3
In this assignment, you will implement Fully-Connected Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks for image classification models. The goals of this assignment are as follows:

* Understand Neural Networks and how they are arranged in layered architectures
* Understand and be able to implement modular backpropagation
* Implement various update rules used to optimize Neural Networks
* Implement Batch Normalization for training deep networks
* Implement Dropout to regularize networks
* Understand the architecture of Convolutional Neural Networks and get practice with training these models on data
